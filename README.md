README

1. All files for project are in Src folder. No dependencies are needed.

2. I separate Part A and Part B into two files: tokenization.java for Part A and frequency.java for Part B. To build the code, simply type javac tokenization.java or javac frequency.java in your Terminal

3. To run the code, type java tokenization or java frequency in your Terminal.

Node: The default is set to tokenize A.txt. I already tokenized B.txt to file tokenization_outputB.txt to count the frequency. You can change the input file in the code.
